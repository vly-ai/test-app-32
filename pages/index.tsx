Here is the rewritten file content for setting up a Next.js project by creating a simple index page. The top of the file includes detailed documentation, outlining the purpose, functions, arguments (if any), returns, and description.

```tsx
/**
 * @file pages/index.tsx
 * @purpose This file is the entry point for the Next.js application. It renders the main homepage of the Task Tracker application.
 * 
 * @description 
 * This file sets up the homepage for a Next.js project. The homepage contains a header that welcomes users to the Task Tracker.
 * Using Next.js's file-based routing, this file can be reached at the base URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000/).
 * 
 * @functions 
 * - Home(): The main functional component that renders the homepage.
 * 
 * @returns {JSX.Element} The JSX code to render the homepage.
 * 
 */

import React from 'react';

/**
 * Home: The main functional component that renders the homepage.
 *
 * @returns {JSX.Element} The JSX code to render the homepage.
 */
const Home: React.FC = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Welcome to Task Tracker</h1>
    <p>Track your tasks efficiently and effortlessly!</p>
  </div>
);

export default Home;
```

This code sets up a minimal Next.js application with a single page that serves as the homepage for the Task Tracker application. It provides a header and a paragraph to welcome users.
