Sure, let's proceed to initialize a Next.js project with the necessary documentation. Our file will be the root `pages/index.js`, which will serve as the entry point of the Next.js application.

Let's create the `pages/index.js` file with detailed documentation.

```javascript
/**
 * @file Overview of the index page of the Next.js application.
 * @description This is the entry point for the Next.js application, serving as the main landing page.
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * - The `index.js` file is the home page of the application.
 * - It renders initial content when users visit the root URL of the website.
 * 
 * Components:
 * - Home: Functional component that serves as the main component for the home page.
 * 
 * Functions:
 * - Home: A React functional component that returns the JSX for the home page.
 * 
 * Returns:
 * - JSX.Element: The rendered component structure for the home page.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - This page is automatically served when the root URL is accessed.
 * - No arguments are required for this file.
 * 
 * Example:
 * ```
 * // No specific example invocation needed as this is the entry point.
 * ```
 */

// Import necessary packages
import Head from 'next/head';

// Home component definition
const Home = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>Task Tracker</title>
        <meta name="description" content="A simple task tracker application" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
      </Head>
      
      <main>
        <h1>Welcome to Task Tracker</h1>
        <p>Your go-to app for keeping track of tasks</p>
      </main>
    </>
  );
};

// Export the Home component as the default export
export default Home;
```

This initial setup provides a basic landing page for the Next.js task tracker application, including necessary HTML head elements through the Next.js `Head` component. The page contains a welcome message and a concise description of the app.
